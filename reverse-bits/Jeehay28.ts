/*
n & 1
- get last bit
- equivalent to n % 2 for non-negative integer

n << 1
- left shift (multiply by 2)

n >>> 1
- Unsigned right shift (divide by 2)
- ignores sign

n >>> 0
- no shift, just cast to unsigned

JavaScript/TypeScript only has one number type â€” a 64-bit float. itwise operations use 32-bit signed integers.
    To return a 32-bit unsigned integer, use >>> 0 on the result.
    
    ðŸ”§ Bitwise Operations in JavaScript â€” Summary
    1. Bitwise operations in JavaScript (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>, >>>) are always performed on 32-bit signed integers.

    2. Internally:
        - JavaScript converts your number into a 32-bit signed integer
        - Performs the bitwise operation
        - Then converts it back into a regular 64-bit number (JavaScript's only number type)

    3. If you need the result as a 32-bit unsigned integer (like for LeetCode problems dealing with uint32):
        - Use >>> 0 at the end of your result
        - This forces the result to be treated as an unsigned 32-bit integer
